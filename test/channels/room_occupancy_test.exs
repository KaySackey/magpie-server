  Race Condition Issues (Client Side)

  - 1. User Leaves or timeout occurs
  - 2. Server says user has left
  - 3. User Returns
  - 4. Server says user has joined

  If message 4 arrives before message 2, then weâ€™ll have a problem.

  We can try and solve this with message ordering. Client will explicitly know what message ID it is waiting on, and if it receives 4 before 2 then it will wait 10 seconds and perform a history check.



  Race Conditions Server Side

  1. User Joins
  2. User leaves
  3. User Joins

  Messages are received as 2, 1, 3.
  This can only happen because of a buggy or evil client.
  Server side... a user cannot leave a room they have not joined. No leave messages will be published.
  When 1 is received, user will join room.
  When 3 is received, user will attempt to join again but room list will not be updated.

  Perhaps 2 connections to the same channel might be created.
